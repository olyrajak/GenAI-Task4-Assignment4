# Task 1: Write Sales Records to a File
# 1. Create a list of sales amounts:
# 2. sales = [1200, 450, 980, 1500, 3000]
# 3. Open a file named sales_data.txt in write mode.
# 4. Write each sale on a new line in the file.
# 5. Close the file, then reopen it and print its contents.
# Extra (optional): Write the data in comma-separated format instead of separate lines.
sales = [1200, 450, 980, 1500, 3000]
